// The wrangler side reuses the submodule's own declarations rather than redeclaring them, so a
// base-config change upstream surfaces here as a type error during `pnpm types:scripts` instead of
// as a silently dropped key at deploy time. The imports are type-only, which under
// `verbatimModuleSyntax` erase completely -- `node` never resolves them, so the submodule's
// runtime dependencies are not this script's problem.
